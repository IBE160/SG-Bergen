# Story 3.2: Turn Management System

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a Player,
I want to clearly see whose turn it is,
so that I know when I can ask a question or when I need to wait.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  **Given** It is my turn **Then** The "Ask Question" and "Make Guess" UI is enabled **And** I see a "Your Turn" indicator.
2.  **Given** It is the opponent's turn **Then** My action UI is disabled **And** I see "Opponent's Turn".
3.  **When** A turn ends (question asked & answered), ownership switches automatically.
4.  UI clearly indicates "Your Turn" vs "Opponent's Turn".
5.  Active player inputs are enabled; Waiting player inputs are disabled.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Architectural/Component References

*   **Real-time Engine:** Supabase Realtime will be used for turn synchronization.
*   **State Management:** Zustand (`useGameStore`) will manage client-side turn status.
*   **Events:** Supabase Realtime `turn-change` event (`payload: { "next_player_id": "..." }`) will signal turn transitions.
*   **Data Model:** `game_sessions` table needs `current_turn_player_id`.
*   **UI Components:** `GamePage` will orchestrate; `InteractionPanel` will show context-aware actions. UI elements for "Ask Question" and "Make Guess" will be enabled/disabled based on turn.
*   **Performance:** Turn updates must occur within 500ms.
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for `useGameStore` logic; Integration tests using `RealtimeTestHarness`.

### Project Structure Notes

*   **Overall Alignment:** The current project structure, as defined in `unified-project-structure.md`, aligns well with the anticipated file paths and component locations for implementing turn management.
*   **Key Components and Locations:**
    *   **Page:** The main game logic will reside within `app/game-play/[code]/page.tsx` (as noted in `previous_story_learnings` for `game-client.tsx` and `page.tsx`).
    *   **State Management:** The `useGameStore` (Zustand) from `lib/store/game.ts` will be extended to manage turn-related state. This aligns with the `lib/` directory for shared utilities and services.
    *   **Realtime Hooks:** `lib/hooks/use-gameplay-subscription.ts` (established in the previous story) or a similar hook will be extended/created to handle Supabase Realtime `turn-change` events. This fits within the `lib/hooks` convention.
    *   **UI Components:** A new `InteractionPanel` component will likely be created under `app/game-play/components/interaction-panel.tsx` to handle asking questions, answering, and making guesses. This aligns with the feature-sliced design for gameplay components.
    *   **Migrations:** Database changes related to turn management (e.g., `current_turn_player_id` in `game_sessions`) will be handled via `supabase/migrations/`.
*   **Reusability:** The existing patterns for Realtime subscriptions (`useGameSubscription` from `2.3-real-time-lobby-player-readiness`) and Zustand stores (`useGameStore` from `3.1-game-board-secret-character-selection`) are directly applicable and will be reused.
*   **Technical Debt Consideration:** The identified technical debt from the previous story regarding "unifying `game_status` enum and `phase` text column" should be considered in this story, as turn management will heavily interact with these status/phase fields. This story provides a suitable context to address this alignment if feasible, or at least maintain consistency.
*   **Conflicts:** No direct conflicts with the established project structure or naming conventions are anticipated.

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 3-1-game-board-secret-character-selection (Status: done)**

- **New Services/Patterns to Reuse**:
  - `player_secrets table`: Used for secure secret character selection.
  - `game_start_trigger`: Server-side logic via trigger `handle_game_start` for game state transitions.
  - `phase column`: New `phase` column for 2-phase start trigger.
  - `useGameStore` for client state, `useGameplaySubscription` for Realtime events.
- **Architectural Decisions**:
  - Use `useGameStore` (Zustand) for client state.
  - Server-side game start logic via trigger `handle_game_start`.
- **Technical Debt to Consider**:
  - Unifying `game_status` enum and `phase` text column in future refactoring.
- **Warnings/Recommendations**:
  - RLS is critical; ensure `players` table policies are correct for any game state where player data is involved.
  - Reuse `useGameSubscription` hook logic or extend it for Gameplay events.
- **Review Findings (for awareness)**:
  - `20251212130000_add_game_phase.sql` migration was missing from Dev Agent Record's file list.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Implement Client-Side Turn State Management (AC: 1, 2)**
  - [ ] Extend `useGameStore` (`lib/store/game.ts`) to manage `current_turn_player_id` and derived `isMyTurn` state.
  - [ ] Implement UI logic in `app/game-play/[code]/page.tsx` to enable/disable "Ask Question" and "Make Guess" buttons based on `isMyTurn`.
  - [ ] Create/integrate a visual "Your Turn" indicator component in `app/game-play/[code]/page.tsx`.
  - [ ] Implement a visual "Opponent's Turn" indicator.
- [ ] **Implement Server-Side Turn Transition Logic (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Implement Supabase Function/Trigger to switch `current_turn_player_id` in `game_sessions` after a question/answer action is completed.
  - [ ] Ensure `current_turn_player_id` is updated in `game_sessions` via Realtime.
- [ ] **Integrate Realtime Turn Events (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Extend `lib/hooks/use-gameplay-subscription.ts` to listen for `turn-change` events on the `game:[game_id]` Realtime channel.
  - [ ] Dispatch `turn-change` events to `useGameStore` to update client-side `current_turn_player_id`.
- [ ] **Testing & Verification**
  - [ ] **Unit Test:** Add tests to `lib/store/game.ts` for `useGameStore` logic related to `current_turn_player_id` updates and `isMyTurn` derivation.
  - [ ] **Unit Test:** Verify turn switching logic correctly handles edge cases (e.g., rapid consecutive updates).
  - [ ] **Integration Test:** Implement `RealtimeTestHarness` to simulate `turn-change` events and verify `useGameStore` and UI updates (referencing `docs/testing/real-time-turn-strategy.md`).
  - [ ] **UI Test:** Create UI tests for `app/game-play/[code]/page.tsx` to verify turn indicators and button enabled/disabled states.
  - [ ] **UI Test:** Verify visual state persists correctly after a page reload (re-hydration from `game_sessions`).
