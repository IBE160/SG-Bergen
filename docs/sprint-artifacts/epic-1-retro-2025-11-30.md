# Epic 1 Retrospective: Project Foundation

**Date:** 2025-11-30
**Participants:** Bob (Scrum Master), Alice (Product Owner), Charlie (Senior Dev), Amelia (Developer), Dana (QA Engineer), Elena (Junior Dev), BIP (Project Lead)

## Summary

The team conducted a retrospective for Epic 1, "Project Foundation." The epic was completed successfully, with all 4 stories delivered. The retrospective focused on identifying successes, challenges, and key learnings to carry forward into Epic 2.

## Epic 1 Summary

*   **Completed:** 4/4 stories (100%)
*   **Technical Debt Identified:** 3 items (README, pinned dependencies, permissive RLS policies)

## Key Learnings & Insights

1.  **Definition of "Done":** The team identified a need to broaden the definition of "done" to include tasks like updating documentation and pinning dependencies, not just shipping functional code.
2.  **Planned Technical Debt:** The practice of explicitly identifying and planning for technical debt (like the permissive RLS policies) was recognized as a positive sign of maturity.
3.  **Value of AI Reviews:** The AI-driven code reviews were praised for catching small but important details, allowing human reviewers to focus on more strategic issues.
4.  **Pre-Epic Preparation:** The discussion highlighted the importance of a dedicated preparation phase before starting a new epic to address security, testing, and knowledge gaps.

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Create "Definition of Done" checklist | Bob (SM) | Before Epic 2 | Pending |
| Pin all `package.json` dependencies | Amelia (Dev) | Before Epic 2 | Pending |
| Update `README.md` with project info | Amelia (Dev) | Before Epic 2 | Pending |

## Epic 2 Preparation Plan

The team agreed on the following preparation tasks before fully committing to Epic 2: "Game Session Management".

## Final Readiness Assessment

*   **Testing & Quality:** Manual validation complete. Ready for Epic 2, which will introduce automated tests.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed and live on Vercel.
*   **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Accepted.
*   **Technical Health:** Solid and stable foundation.
*   **Unresolved Blockers:** The planned technical debt of RLS policies is now a critical path item for the prep phase.

## Conclusion

The retrospective was successful. The team is aligned on the successes and challenges of Epic 1 and has a clear, actionable plan to prepare for Epic 2.
