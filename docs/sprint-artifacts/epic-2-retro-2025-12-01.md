# Epic 2 Retrospective: Game Session Management

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Participants:** Bob (Scrum Master), Alice (Product Owner), Charlie (Senior Dev), Dana (QA Engineer), Elena (Junior Dev), Amelia (Developer), BIP (Project Lead)

## Summary

The team conducted a retrospective for Epic 2, "Game Session Management." The epic was completed successfully with 100% of stories delivered. The retrospective highlighted the success of the real-time implementation and the value of preparation spikes. However, it also identified a need to improve follow-through on maintenance tasks from previous retrospectives and underscored the critical need for automated E2E testing before entering the complex gameplay logic of Epic 3.

## Epic 2 Summary

*   **Completed:** 3/3 stories (100%)
*   **Velocity:** ~3 story points (approx. 1 point/story)
*   **Duration:** ~1 Sprint
*   **Technical Debt:** 1 item (Deferred E2E testing)
*   **Production Incidents:** 0

## Key Learnings & Insights

1.  **Real-time Architecture Validated:** The successful implementation of Supabase Realtime for the lobby proved the architecture choice is sound and provides a good user experience.
2.  **Preparation Pays Off:** The specific spike on Realtime technology by the Junior Dev significantly smoothed the implementation of Story 2.3.
3.  **Follow-Through is Critical:** Action items from the previous retrospective (DoD, pinning dependencies, seed script) were not completed, leading to continued friction. A better tracking process is needed.
4.  **Automation is Essential:** As complexity grows with the gameplay loop, manual testing is no longer sustainable. E2E testing is a critical prerequisite for Epic 3.

## Action Items

### Process Improvements
| Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create 'Definition of Done' Checklist** | Bob (SM) | Epic 3 Kickoff | Document exists in `docs/` and is used in workflow. |
| **Establish Retro Action Item Tracking** | Bob (SM) | Next Sprint Planning | Sprint planning agenda includes "Review Retro Actions". |

### Technical Debt / Cleanup
| Action | Owner | Priority | Est. Effort |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pin `package.json` Dependencies** | Amelia (Dev) | High | 0.5h |
| **Update `README.md`** | Amelia (Dev) | Medium | 0.5h |

### Testing Infrastructure
| Action | Owner | Priority | Est. Effort |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Create Test User Seed Script** | Charlie (Senior Dev) | High | 2h |
| **Setup E2E Testing Framework** | Dana (QA Engineer) | Critical | 4h |

## Epic 3 Preparation Plan

The team agreed on the following preparation tasks before fully committing to **Epic 3: Core Gameplay Loop**.

### Critical Path (Must be completed before Epic 3 starts)
1.  **Setup E2E Testing Framework** (Dana)
2.  **Database Migration for Gameplay** (Charlie) - Add `current_turn_player_id`, create `moves` table.

### Parallel Tasks (Can be done during early Epic 3 stories)
1.  **Turn Management Technical Design** (Charlie) - Document state flow and sync logic.

## Final Readiness Assessment

*   **Testing & Quality:** Needs Automation. **Action:** Setup E2E Framework.
*   **Deployment:** Stable.
*   **Stakeholder Acceptance:** Assumed Positive.
*   **Technical Health:** Good.
*   **Unresolved Blockers:** None.

## Conclusion

Epic 2 was a success, but the team recognizes that Epic 3 represents a significant jump in complexity. The team is **conditionally clear to proceed**, contingent on the completion of the critical preparation tasks, specifically the E2E testing framework and database updates.
