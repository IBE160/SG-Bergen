# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-26
**Facilitator:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** The Game Flow

**Techniques Used:** Mind Mapping, Reversal Inversion

**Total Ideas Generated:** 3 Key Design Principles

### Key Themes Identified:

- Clarity in User Interface and Instructions
- Robustness in Handling unexpected user actions (like disconnections)
- Providing a Satisfying and Clear User Experience, especially at the conclusion of the game.

## Technique Sessions

### Reversal Inversion: Identifying Weaknesses

We used the Reversal Inversion technique to identify potential weaknesses in the game flow by asking "How could we make this worse?". This led to the following insights:

1.  **Starting and Joining a Game:** The process could be made frustrating by having unclear instructions and confusing buttons. This highlighted the need for a simple and intuitive onboarding process.

2.  **Core Gameplay Loop:** The most frustrating experience would be a player disconnecting mid-game, causing the game to freeze for the remaining player. This identified the need for a robust disconnection and reconnection system.

3.  **Winning the Game:** An ambiguous or non-existent win/loss screen would make the end of the game feel unsatisfying. This showed the importance of clear and celebratory feedback.

## Idea Categorization

### Design Principles (Immediate Opportunities)

Based on the weaknesses identified, we established the following design principles to ensure a strong user experience:

*   **Clear Visual Hierarchy & Simple Labels:** The most important buttons should be prominent, and labels should be action-oriented (e.g., "Create Game", "Enter Code").

*   **Robust Reconnection System:** The game must handle disconnections gracefully, with a grace period for reconnection and clear status updates for the remaining player.

*   **Celebratory & Unambiguous Win/Loss Screens:** The outcome of the game should be communicated clearly and in a satisfying way, with options for a rematch.
